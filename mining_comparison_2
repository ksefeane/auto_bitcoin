2. profitability rates for various coins & hardware

For this comparison we will be using the AMD Radeon RX 580 2048SP 8gb GPU as the benchmark, with an assumption of 0 electricity cost & 1% pool fees. 

The RX 580 has an average hashrate of 25 Mh/s.
The mining calculator used is from coinwarz.com/mining/<cryptoname>
The hashrate calculator used is from https://crypt0.zone/calculator

The example crypto currencies used will be: ethereum, monero & zcash
The fiat price of each crypto currency varies as the market is unpredictable so the comparison will be calculating the amount of cryptocurrency that can be mined.

Bitcoin is overcrowded with miners with a high mining difficulty, therefore it will not be included in this calculation.
Litecoin uses specialized hardware for mining, i.e litecoin mining machine - graphic card or custom Scrypt ASIC, and therefore will not be included in this calculation


Time 		| Ethereum	| Monero	| Zcash		|
================================================
daily		| 0.00239	| 0.00160	| 0.00038	|
------------------------------------------------
weekly		| 0.01674	| 0.01122	| 0.00271	|
------------------------------------------------
monthly		| 0.0718	| 0.0481	| 0.0117	|
------------------------------------------------
annually	| 0.8731	| 0.5851	| 0.1418	|
================================================
Hashes		| 26.7 mh/s	| 1225 h/s	| 290 sol/s	|

This calculation is based on the use of 1 gpu with a altcoin dependant hashrate. The mineable amount will vary based on number of GPU's & mining difficulty.

We suggest mining Monero due to it's high mining reward, low difficulty setup & stable fiat market price.
